This version is installed in Linac-3.
There is a GIT archive aswell as an RCS directory in each directory.
The directories are...

   driver   Diver sources and make file
   install  The lynxos install program
   lib      Library sources and makefile
   test     Driver test program sources and makefile

This directory is an exact copy of /acc/src/dsc/drivers/lrfsc
There is a port of an older version to Linux, but that version will need to
be upgraded to reflect the logic here. The FPGA has been changed a lot, and
there were misunderstandings in the way the diagnostics worked. This version
is fully tested and is operational.
